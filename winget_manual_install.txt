Winget Installation Help
=========================

To install Winget manually, follow these steps:

1. Run this command in PowerShell as Administrator:

powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheroto/winget-installer/master/winget-install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex"

2. That's it. After install, just run the 1 Click Software Installer again.

If you're still having issues, make sure:
- Your Windows is updated (Windows 10 1809+ or Windows 11)
- Microsoft Store is working properly
